CodeAid: AI Code Language Predictor
CodeAid is an AI-powered tool that identifies the programming language of a given code snippet. Using deep learning models trained on large-scale datasets like CodeNet and CodeSearchNet, CodeAid provides accurate, fast, and scalable language classification for source code.

üöÄ Features
Predicts code language from snippets with high accuracy
Supports 10 languages: Python, Java, C++, C#, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, C, Rust, Haskell
Based on CNN & Sequential models with tokenization and dropout
Trained on 2M+ code samples using Project CodeNet

üß† Model Architecture
Input Layer: Functional input, 64,512 token length
Dense Layers: Feature compression to 128 dimensions
Dropout: Prevents overfitting
Output Layer: 10-class softmax for language prediction.
